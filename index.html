<h1>Battleship-like</h1>
<p>
    This is a game that is very similar to Battleship, a popular game.
    You can take turns with the AI, trying to sink each other's ships.
    A ship on your board is denoted with an S. The "ocean" is denoted by an O.
    If the AI misses, that spot will be denoted by an -. If he hits, it will be denoted by a D.
    As you attack the AI's board, it will be denoted with an X for a miss or a D for a hit.
    You can attack the board by inputting a row and column below. The boards have numbers on their sides.

    The first player to sink all 10 ships wins the game. Good luck!
